# Dicee ðŸŽ²

## Our Goal

Flutter Dice App This Flutter application simulates rolling two dice, displaying their values visually on the screen. It's a simple yet fun project aimed at demonstrating the basics of building user interfaces and handling user interactions in Flutter.


## What you will create

Weâ€™re going to make a Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be able to settle any score on the go!
